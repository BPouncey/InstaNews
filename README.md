### Personal Learnings

# GULP: Task-runner
I learned how to utilise task-runner ```GULP``` to Automate and streamline my work flow.
We created a gulp.js file to minify my app.js and streamedline my SASS into pure CSS3 live in a browser sync.  

# SASS:
This was the first time I was introduced to the stylesheet language SASS. I learnt how to use SASS variables, nested rules, and mixins to create a more symantic readable stylesheet.
